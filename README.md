Waste management at MacEwan University is a voluminous task. Thousands of students each day dispose of waste into every garbage bin on campus on a daily basis. To keep them from overflowing, these garbage bins require regular monitoring and collection services on a regular basis by maintenance staff on campus. This requires a vast amount of resource expenditure on behalf of MacEwan University in terms of labour and capital.

According to MacEwan University sustainability statistics, an estimated 63% of waste was diverted from the landfill in 2012 and 2013. In 2014, MacEwan University diverted 65% of their trash from the landfill and by 2020, they hope to reach a 90% diversion rate from the landfill.

Maximizing waste management efficiency and increased sustainability has become a primary focus of many educational institutions and businesses all across North America. At the forefront of this trend, is the implementation of information technology and intelligent systems into the waste management process. Automated and SMART processes allow human resources to be more efficiently deployed on other tasks and save money for the administrators by reducing labour costs. One such method is remote monitoring of garbage bin capacity.

One method of remote monitoring of garbage bin capacity involves deploying proximity sensors inside the garbage bin which can detect the capacity of garbage in that specific bin. These sensors are connected to a node, which can transmit sensor data to an external server where these sensor readings can be interpreted, logged and displayed to a client located off site via wireless networking. This IoT waste management project is based precisely on this model.
